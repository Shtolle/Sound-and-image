In this project called CyberLines I’ve used mathematical functions to create an illusion of a 3 dimensional scape in retrowave style 

In this project called Galaxy I’ve explored a particle behaviour in space ? where thy have forces of attraction and repulsion. You create new particles as you slide your mouse held through the sky full of stars. 

In this Project called pix I’ve created a programme that allows you to upload an image and make it pixelated and b/w at the same time.

In this project called “stars” I’ve created a canvas full of stars but when you move your mouse across it - particles experience different forces

In this project called “epilepsy” I’ve made a recursion pattern with lots of squares. They also bling chaotically and make a cool visual effect
